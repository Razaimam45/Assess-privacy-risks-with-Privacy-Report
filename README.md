# Assess-privacy-risks-with-Privacy-Report

##### In this project we train a simple image classification model on the CIFAR10 dataset, and then use the "membership inference attack" against this model to assess if the attacker is able to "guess" whether a particular sample was present in the training set. We use the TF Privacy Report to visualize results from multiple models and model checkpoints.
